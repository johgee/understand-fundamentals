tradeoffs
-never one "best" solution to a problbem

C

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a = 1;
  while (a <= 100)
  {
    printf ("hello world\n");
    a++;
  }
  return 0;
}

C IS FASTER

RUBY 
100.times do
  puts "hello word"
end 

RUBY IS EASIER TO READ

financial software companies = speed 
company website = maybe easier to read
